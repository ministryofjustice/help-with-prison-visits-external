      </ul>
      <p>This service is managed by HMPPS, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). MOJ is the data controller for the personal information we hold.</p>

      <h5 class="heading-medium">About personal information</h5>

      <p>We know how important it is to protect your privacy and to comply with data protection laws. We will keep your personal data safe and will only disclose it where it is lawful to do so, or with your consent.</p>

      <h5 class="heading-medium">Types of personal data we process</h5>      
      <p>We only process personal data that is relevant for the services we are providing to you. We also collect site-usage information which allows us to see how the service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This information does not contain any personal data. It includes:</p>

        <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave if you send a message via feedback</li>
        <li>your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you used</li>
        <li>information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques to help us improve the website</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This helps us to:</p>

        <li>respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to</li>

      <h5 class="heading-medium">Who the information may be shared with</h5>
